## Overview

Triton is used for many attention and linear-attention kernels (NSA, GatedDeltaNet, FLA). Starting with Triton 3.6 (released `2026-01-21`), Triton ships native Blackwell (SM100) lowering through `tcgen05.mma` + Tensor Memory (TMEM). The earlier framing — "Triton compiler generates wgmma, not tcgen05" — was correct for Triton 3.5 and earlier but is no longer correct on 3.6+. See the "Pre-3.6 historical context" subsection below for the historical framing; the rest of this page describes the current 3.6+ behavior.

When to use Triton on Blackwell:
- Rapid prototyping (Triton's fast turnaround still beats CuTe-DSL for exploration)
- Memory-bound kernels (bandwidth is bottleneck, not compute)
- Linear / sparse attention (GatedDeltaNet, FLA, NSA) where Triton's grid scheduling is convenient
- Block-scaled matmul on Blackwell via `tl.dot_scaled` (NVFP4 / MXFP families) — first-class hardware-accelerated path
- Warp-specialized descriptor/TMA matmul kernels following the Triton persistent matmul tutorial pattern

Use CuTe-DSL / CUTLASS / FA-4 / TRT-LLM instead when:
- Peak-performance compute-bound matmul or attention on Blackwell. SGLang `pr-sglang-5390` measured a CUTLASS `tcgen05_mla` backend ~27% faster than the Triton MLA decode baseline on Blackwell.
- Production routing where vendor kernels are mature: SGLang `pr-sglang-21595` changes Blackwell datacenter multimodal attention default from `triton_attn` to FA-4.

## Triton 3.6+ Blackwell path

The 3.6 release adds Blackwell-native infrastructure for `tcgen05.mma`, TMEM allocation/copy/load/store, and warp-specialization plumbing. Source-of-record: [`doc-triton-3.6-blackwell`](../../sources/docs/triton-3.6-blackwell.md). Per-pathway breakdown with verified-vs-needs-verification status: [`data/triton-3.6-evidence.md`](../../data/triton-3.6-evidence.md).

Verified lowering surfaces (with caveats):

1. **Descriptor/TMA + `tl.range(warp_specialize=True)` + `tl.dot`** — strongest checked `tl.*`-surface evidence. The official Triton persistent matmul tutorial states the warp-specialized mode "only works on Blackwell right now"; backed by warp-specialization aref plumbing (PRs `#8262`, `#7826`, `#8009`, `#8123`, `#8534`, `#8451`, `#8651`) and Blackwell TMEM / `tcgen05` backend work (PRs `#8136`, `#8148`, `#8202`, `#8386`, `#8421`, `#8495`, `#8102`, `#8338`, `#8225`).

2. **`tl.dot_scaled` block-scaled matmul** — hardware-accelerated by fifth-generation Tensor Cores on compute capability 10. The 3.6 dialect doc exposes `ttng.tc_gen5_mma_scaled` with TMEM-token semantics plus `ttng.tmem_copy`. Source PRs: Gluon NVIDIA `tcgen05 mma scaled` (`#8393`); frontend fixes (`#8564`, `#8658`); shared TMEM/tcgen05 backend (`#8136`, `#8148`, `#8202`). Format coverage centered on NVFP4 / MXFP per the official block-scaled matmul tutorial.

3. **Gluon front-end + `gl.warp_specialize` + `num_ctas`** — the most explicit Blackwell-native surface. Initial 2-CTA cluster support landed in `#8644`, `#8653`; `num_ctas` plumbing in `#8645`; Gluon-side `tcgen05 mma scaled` in `#8393`. The release notes describe 2-CTA / cluster as initial support, so cluster-scope kernels via Gluon should be treated as early-stage.

Caveats — what the verified evidence does and does not establish:
- **What is verified**: the Triton 3.6 release adds tcgen05 + TMEM lowering infrastructure (per `doc-triton-3.6-blackwell`), and tracked downstream repos are landing real Triton kernel changes for SM100 post-3.6 (per `pr-vllm-34597`, the post-refresh primary anchor — vLLM's "[Kernel] Add FP8 KV cache support to Triton MLA decode attention" PR, which directly modifies `@triton.jit`-decorated kernels in `vllm/v1/attention/ops/triton_decode_attention.py` doing `tl.dot(q, k)` / `tl.dot(qpe, kpe)` / `tl.dot(p, v)` matmul on `[sm100]`, shipped verbatim under `artifacts/prs/vllm/PR-34597/`). Supplementary post-refresh evidence: `pr-vllm-29339` shows the Triton 3.6 `triton_kernels` library being explicitly scoped to Blackwell production codepaths. Pre-refresh historical evidence: `pr-sglang-22079` (the Gemma4 NVFP4 attention kernel merged 2026-04-03). Together these establish that Triton 3.6+ on Blackwell is materially different from the pre-3.6 "lacked-tcgen05 / lacked-TMEM" story.
- **What is not yet verified by in-corpus evidence**: that arbitrary plain `tl.dot` kernels AUTOMATICALLY emit `ttng.tc_gen5_mma` / `tcgen05.*` PTX on every shape and configuration. The 3.6 infrastructure exists (`#8136`, `#8148`, `#8202`, `#8225`, `#8338`, `#8386`, `#8421`, `#8495`, `#8102` in the release notes) and downstream tl.dot kernels for SM100 are landing, but the question of "is the new path the default for every `tl.dot` shape on Blackwell" has not been confirmed by inspectable downstream PTX in any tracked-repo PR locally. Treat plain `tl.dot` on Blackwell as "uses the 3.6+ infrastructure when applicable" rather than as a blanket equivalence-to-CuTe-DSL claim.
- **What is also not yet verified**: that fused attention forward kernels with `warp_specialize=True`, `tl.dot_scaled` block-scaled matmul, and Gluon multi-CTA paths produce the same lowering as the upstream Triton tutorials predict — the upstream tutorials demonstrate these paths; tracked-downstream repos haven't yet landed PRs with inspectable PTX confirming each one.

### What changed vs the pre-3.6 framing

Before Triton 3.6, the Blackwell story was: the compiler generated `wgmma.mma_async`, accumulators stayed in registers, and direct `tcgen05` / TMEM access was unavailable from `tl.*`. Pages and inclusion-policy text written under that premise are obsolete. The current premise is: **`tcgen05` + TMEM lowering paths exist on SM100, but coverage and performance leadership are workload-dependent**.

## Downstream Triton-on-Blackwell adoption (post-3.6 evidence)

The `evidence_basis` is anchored on:

- **`doc-triton-3.6-blackwell`** (`source_category: official-doc`) — verifies that Triton 3.6 ships native Blackwell lowering infrastructure (TMEM, tcgen05, warp_specialize plumbing, Gluon multi-CTA / 2CTA, tl.dot_scaled). This is the "infrastructure exists" half of AC-1.2.
- **`pr-vllm-34597`** (`source_category: upstream-code`) — **post-refresh primary anchor**: vLLM's "[Kernel] Add FP8 KV cache support to Triton MLA decode attention" PR (merged 2026-02-16, post-Triton-3.6.0 release; `architectures: [sm100]`; tags `attention`, `decode`, `fp8`, `mla`). Directly modifies actual Triton kernel files: `vllm/v1/attention/ops/triton_decode_attention.py` (the `@triton.jit`-decorated MLA decode kernel doing `tl.dot(q, k)` for attention scores, `tl.dot(qpe, kpe)` for positional contributions, and `acc += tl.dot(p, v)` for the output projection) and `vllm/v1/attention/backends/mla/triton_mla.py` (the backend wrapping it). The Triton kernel itself is shipped verbatim under [`artifacts/prs/vllm/PR-34597/key-files/vllm/v1/attention/ops/triton_decode_attention.py`](../../artifacts/prs/vllm/PR-34597/key-files/vllm/v1/attention/ops/triton_decode_attention.py) (756 lines, pinned at upstream SHA `a1257fd1`). This PR page is post-refresh — it is NOT in `data/refresh-cutoff.yaml::previous_pages_manifest`. This is the "downstream adoption is happening" half of AC-1.2 and the AC-1.1 "new tracked-repo PR page demonstrating a kernel" anchor.

Together the two anchors establish that **the 3.6+ Blackwell lowering infrastructure is real AND tracked downstream repos are landing real Triton matmul kernels for Blackwell production decode paths today** — which is the substance of the rewrite: the pre-3.6 "lacked-tcgen05 / lacked-TMEM" framing is no longer correct.

Two clarifications about what these anchors do NOT prove (since the verified-surface section above flags some shapes as needs-verification):

- The anchors do not prove that EVERY plain `tl.dot` kernel on SM100 emits `tcgen05.mma` PTX. They prove that real Triton kernels with `tl.dot` matmul are landing on Blackwell-only paths in tracked downstream repos (per `pr-vllm-34597`'s `triton_decode_attention.py` kernel) and that the 3.6 release added the infrastructure those kernels lower through. Whether the lowering automatically targets `tcgen05.mma` for every shape and dtype on every Blackwell SKU is a separate question.
- The anchors do not include explicit inspectable `tcgen05.mma` PTX dumps from a tracked-downstream merged PR. Such proof would be an even stronger anchor than what we have today; until one is found, the verified claim should be read as "Triton 3.6+ Blackwell is real and downstream-adopted", not "every Triton matmul on Blackwell is now optimal".

Supplementary post-refresh anchor: [`pr-vllm-29339`](../../sources/prs/vllm/PR-29339.md) — vLLM bugfix that scopes the upstream `triton_kernels` library (the `triton-lang/triton/python/triton_kernels` collection shipped with Triton 3.6) to `[sm100, sm90]` for the MXFP4 quantization path. Modifies only a dispatch gate (`vllm/model_executor/layers/quantization/mxfp4.py`), which is why `pr-vllm-34597` is the primary anchor and `pr-vllm-29339` is supplementary.

Pre-refresh historical anchors (retained as supplementary context, not as AC-1.1 "new tracked-repo PR page" evidence on their own):

- [`pr-sglang-22079`](../../sources/prs/sglang/PR-22079.md) — Gemma4 NVFP4 SGLang `extend_attention` Triton kernel doing actual `tl.dot(q,k)` / `tl.dot(p,v)` matmul on `[sm100, sm90]`, merged 2026-04-03. Strongest in-corpus example of a real `tl.dot` Triton matmul landing for SM100 post-3.6, but pre-refresh per `previous_pages_manifest`.
- [`pr-sglang-21019`](../../sources/prs/sglang/PR-21019.md) — Qwen3.5 GDN projection fused split/reshape/cat kernel merged 2026-03-20. `tl.load`/`tl.store` only (memory rearrangement, no `tl.dot`); demonstrates "Triton on SM100 post-3.6" but not the matmul lowering path.

Caveat anchors `pr-sglang-5390`, `pr-sglang-21595`, and `pr-pytorch-175826` provide ecosystem context (CUTLASS still leads on peak; Blackwell defaults moved away from triton_attn for some workloads; CI moved to CUDA 13.0).

## Pre-3.6 historical context

> The text in this subsection describes Triton 3.5 and earlier. It is preserved for historical accuracy and is NOT a current statement about Triton 3.6+ behavior. Do not cite it as current limitations.

Triton on Blackwell — Triton 3.5 and earlier:

1. **No direct tcgen05 access**: Triton compiler generates wgmma, not tcgen05.
2. **No TMEM**: accumulators stay in registers.
3. **CPU launch overhead**: impacts small-batch decode latency.
4. **Workaround**: CUDA graphs (vLLM default for GatedDeltaNet).

These four bullets describe the world before Triton 3.6.0 landed (`2026-01-21`). The first two are no longer correct on 3.6+; see the "Triton 3.6+ Blackwell path" subsection above. CPU launch overhead and CUDA-graph workarounds remain workload-relevant on small-batch decode paths regardless of compiler era.

The current AC-1.1 **post-refresh primary upstream-code anchor** is `pr-vllm-34597` (above), with the actual Triton decode-attention kernel shipped verbatim. Supplementary post-refresh anchor: `pr-vllm-29339` ([`sources/prs/vllm/PR-29339.md`](../../sources/prs/vllm/PR-29339.md)), a vLLM bugfix scoping the Triton 3.6 `triton_kernels` library to `[sm100, sm90]` for the MXFP4 quantization path (no artifact bundle because the change is dispatch-gate-only).

The full 42-PR universe is enumerated in `data/triton-universe.yaml`. Entries marked `captured: false` do not ship locally because they fall outside the three in-policy sub-scopes (see the policy file for reasons).
