blackwell_relevance: Blackwell uses 16-warp single-thread MMA model (vs Hopper's 4-warp
  warp-group); fundamentally different structure.

## Overview

Warp specialization assigns distinct functional roles to warps within a CTA, allowing each warp to focus on a single pipeline stage (data loading, MMA computation, or epilogue writeback). On Blackwell (SM100), the 16-warp CTA structure replaces Hopper's 4-warp warpgroup model. Because tcgen05.mma is a single-thread instruction that operates on TMEM rather than registers, only one warp needs to issue MMA operations, freeing the remaining warps for producer and consumer roles.

## Blackwell 16-Warp Kernel Structure

The canonical Blackwell GEMM kernel uses 16 warps (512 threads) per CTA with the following role assignment:

| Warp ID | Role | Responsibility |
|---------|------|----------------|
| 0 | TMA Producer | Issues TMA bulk-copy from global to shared memory, signals mbarrier |
| 1 | MMA Consumer | Issues tcgen05.mma on SMEM operands, writes results to TMEM |
| 2-15 | Epilogue | Reads TMEM accumulator, applies scale/bias/activation, writes to global memory |

This contrasts with Hopper where a warpgroup (4 warps, 128 threads) collectively issues wgmma.mma_async, and all threads in the warpgroup participate in the MMA. On Blackwell, the MMA warp dispatches the instruction from a single thread while the hardware handles the data movement internally.

## Comparison with Hopper Warpgroup Model

| Aspect | Hopper (SM90) | Blackwell (SM100) |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| MMA granularity | 4-warp warpgroup (128 threads) | Single thread in 1 warp |
| MMA output destination | Registers (shared across warpgroup) | TMEM (256KB, CTA-visible) |
| Producer warps | Separate warp(s) for TMA loads | Warp 0 dedicated to TMA |
| Epilogue execution | Same warpgroup or separate warps | 14 dedicated warps (2-15) |
| Synchronization | warpgroup barriers, arrive/wait | mbarrier pairs (producer/consumer) |
| Register pressure | High (accumulators in registers) | Low (accumulators in TMEM) |

## Warp Role Assignment

The kernel entry point assigns each warp its role based on `threadIdx.x`:

```cuda
// Blackwell 16-warp specialized GEMM kernel skeleton
// 16 warps = 512 threads per CTA

        // Signal epilogue warps that accumulation is complete
        if (lane_id == 0) {

        }

    } else {

        // Each epilogue warp handles a partition of the TMEM output.

                params.C[r * params.N + c] = __float2half(result);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## mbarrier Synchronization Pattern

The producer-consumer synchronization uses mbarrier pairs. Each pipeline stage has two barriers:

1. **data_ready**: Producer (Warp 0) arrives after TMA completes. Consumer (Warp 1) waits before issuing MMA.
2. **buffer_free**: Consumer (Warp 1) arrives after MMA consumes the data. Producer (Warp 0) waits before overwriting the buffer.

At the PTX level, the mbarrier operations map to:

```ptx
// Producer: signal data is ready in stage %stage
mbarrier.arrive.shared.b64  %dummy, [%mbar_data_ready + %stage_offset];

// Consumer: wait for data to be ready
mbarrier.try_wait.parity.shared.b64  %pred, [%mbar_data_ready + %stage_offset], %phase;

// Consumer: signal buffer is consumed
mbarrier.arrive.shared.b64  %dummy, [%mbar_buffer_free + %stage_offset];

// Producer: wait for buffer to be free
mbarrier.try_wait.parity.shared.b64  %pred, [%mbar_buffer_free + %stage_offset], %phase;
```

## CUTLASS SM100 Warp Specialization

In CUTLASS 4.5.0, the SM100 GEMM collective (`CollectiveMma_1SM`) implements this pattern with CuTe abstractions:

```cuda
// CUTLASS SM100 warp role dispatch (simplified from CollectiveMma)
// Template parameter WarpCount = cute::Shape<1, 1, 14>
// Warp 0 = producer, Warp 1 = math, Warps 2-15 = epilogue

template <class TiledMma, class SmemLayout>
struct CollectiveMma_1SM {
    static constexpr int NumProducerWarps = 1;
    static constexpr int NumMathWarps = 1;
    static constexpr int NumEpilogueWarps = 14;

    CUTLASS_DEVICE void operator()(
        Params const& params,
        char* smem_buf,
        TiledMma& tiled_mma)
    {
        int warp_idx = cutlass::canonical_warp_idx_sync();

        if (warp_idx == 0) {
            producer_warp(params, smem_buf);
        } else if (warp_idx == 1) {
            math_warp(params, smem_buf, tiled_mma);
        } else {
            epilogue_warp(params, smem_buf);
        }
    }
};
```

## Hopper Warp Specialization Optimizations

On Hopper (SM90), warp specialization for persistent matmul differs from the Blackwell single-thread MMA model. Triton PR #6299 (merged 2025-03-27) documents several Hopper-specific optimizations that brought persistent matmul to 1247 TFLOPS on H100 (M=N=8192, K=512, fp16):

### Rematerialization of Captures

When `ttg.warp_specialize` partitions a function into warp-group regions, values defined outside the region that are used inside become "captures." Captures force data movement between warps, adding overhead. The rematerialization optimization identifies small groups of pure operations whose only inputs are kernel arguments, and duplicates (rematerializes) them inside each partition region. This removes most captures — especially `ttg.local_alloc` (shared memory allocation handles) and arithmetic over grid constants.

### Dedicated Signaling Warpgroup

Instead of having the MMA warpgroup wait for its own completion and then signal the load warpgroup, an extra warpgroup is allocated exclusively for signaling:

```
Before:  [Producer warps] → [MMA warps (compute + wait + signal)]
After:   [Producer warps] → [MMA warps (compute only)]
                              [Signal warp (wait MMA → signal Load)]
```

This removes the MMA-wait latency from the compute partition, allowing the tensor core pipeline to stay filled with more instructions. The signaling warpgroup is lightweight — it only executes barriers and branches.

### Tensor Descriptor Multibuffering

TMA tensor descriptors (needed for `cp.async.bulk` on Hopper) are allocated per-stage. With multibuffering enabled, unused descriptors are properly DCE'd, and the warp specialization pass allocates descriptors for all pipeline stages, preventing descriptor stalls when stages rotate.

### num_stages Convention Alignment

The `num_stages` parameter was fixed to match the software pipelining convention: `num_stages = number of load buffers` (previously it counted MMA buffers, causing off-by-one mismatches between the pipeliner and warp specialization passes).

## When to Use

- **Always on Blackwell GEMMs**: Warp specialization is the standard pattern for SM100 tensor core kernels. The tcgen05 instruction model assumes single-thread dispatch with TMEM output.
- **Attention kernels**: FlashAttention-4 extends this to ping-pong scheduling with 2 query tile groups and dedicated softmax warps.
- **Any kernel with producer-consumer pipeline**: When TMA loads and MMA compute can overlap, warp specialization provides the cleanest decomposition.

## Caveats

- The 14 epilogue warps may be underutilized for simple epilogues (e.g., pure store). Complex epilogues (scale, bias, activation, quantization) benefit more.
- The single MMA warp means the kernel cannot overlap multiple independent MMA streams within a CTA. Use 2-SM cooperative mode for larger tiles instead.
- mbarrier initialization must happen before any warp tries to wait; use `__syncthreads()` after init if needed.

## H200 / Triton 3.6 status (2026-07-20)

PR #6299 improves Triton's **compiler-internal** automatic warp
specialization (`AutomaticWarpSpecialization.cpp`, `LoadMMASpecialization.cpp`)
for persistent matmul — rematerialization of pure ops inside partition regions,
a dedicated signaling warpgroup, and tensor-descriptor multibuffering. These
are pass-level optimizations, not a user-facing kernel attribute. In the Triton
3.6.0 build on the H200 there is **no `enable_warp_specialization` launch kwarg
or compile option** (only `launch_pdl` is exposed); warp specialization is
applied automatically by the compiler for eligible persistent + TMA matmul
patterns and cannot be toggled off from Python for an A/B comparison. The per-PR
compiler-internal changes are therefore not harness-isolatable on this
toolchain; the source-reported 1247 TFLOPS on H100 (fp16, M=N=8192, K=512) is
not reproduced here. Deferred to an IR/asm-level test or a Triton build that
exposes a WS toggle.
