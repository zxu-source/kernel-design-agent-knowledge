# Topic Map / Primer

A compact, authoritative map of the knowledge base. Use this as a fast lookup table when the user's question is broad — each row tells you exactly which page to open.

All page IDs below resolve via `get_page.py <id>`. All paths are relative to the wiki root (the directory containing `data/`, `wiki/`, `sources/`, `queries/`).

## Hardware Features (SM100)

| Feature | Page ID | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| tcgen05 MMA instruction | `hw-tcgen05-mma` | `wiki/hardware/tcgen05-mma.md` | Blackwell tensor core instruction; replaces wgmma. CTA-scope (`cta_group::1`) or cluster-scope (`cta_group::2`). |
| Tensor Memory (TMEM) | `hw-tmem` | `wiki/hardware/tmem.md` | 256 KB/SM dedicated accumulator storage; 128 rows × 512 cols (32-bit); allocated via `tcgen05.alloc`. |
| Cluster Launch Control (CLC) | `hw-clc` | `wiki/hardware/clc.md` | Hardware work queue for persistent kernels; `clusterlaunchcontrol.try_cancel` for speculative workloads. |
| Tensor Memory Accelerator (TMA) | `hw-tma` | `wiki/hardware/tma.md` | Async bulk load/store (`cp.async.bulk.tensor`), multicast across cluster. |
| 2-SM Cooperative MMA | `hw-2sm-cooperative` | `wiki/hardware/2sm-cooperative.md` | `cta_group::2` — two CTAs in one cluster cooperate on a single MMA. |
| NVFP4 / block-scaled FP | `hw-nvfp4` | `wiki/hardware/nvfp4.md` | E2M1 data + FP8 (UE8M0) block scale per 16 elements. |
| PDL / GDC | `hw-pdl-gdc` | `wiki/hardware/pdl-gdc.md` | Programmatic Dependent Launch and Grid Dependency Control — overlap successive kernel launches. |
| mbarrier primitives | `hw-mbarrier` | `wiki/hardware/mbarrier.md` | Shared-memory barriers with phase tracking; the glue between TMA/tcgen05/warps. |

## Optimization Techniques

| Technique | Page ID | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| Warp specialization | `technique-warp-specialization` | Every nontrivial Blackwell kernel. Assign MMA / epilogue / TMA roles to different warps. |
| Persistent kernels with CLC | `technique-persistent-kernels` | GEMM-like workloads with many tiles; eliminates launch overhead and tail effects. |
| Ping-pong scheduling | `technique-ping-pong-scheduling` | Attention / back-to-back GEMMs; overlap two tiles by alternating SMEM buffers. |
| Epilogue fusion | `technique-epilogue-fusion` | Fuse scale/bias/activation/quantize into the same kernel using TMEM-to-register epilogue warps. |
| Software pipelining | `technique-pipeline-stages` | Multi-stage TMA→MMA overlap; typically 3–5 stages. |
| Shared memory swizzling | `technique-swizzling` | Eliminate SMEM bank conflicts on A/B tile loads. |
| Fine-grained FP8/FP4 quantization | `technique-fine-grained-quantization` | Per-tile or per-block scaling to preserve accuracy under aggressive quantization. |
| Tile scheduling | `technique-tile-scheduling` | L2 locality, cluster reordering, CLC swizzle patterns. |
| Double/multi-buffering | `technique-double-buffering` | Classical approach; overlaps load with compute, extends to 3+ stages. |
| Software-emulated exp | `technique-software-exp` | FlashAttention softmax; cheaper than the hardware `ex2` path in specific regimes. |
| Register budgeting | `technique-register-budgeting` | Raise occupancy when MMA warp counts are tight. |
| Cache policy differentiation | `technique-cache-policy` | PTX `evict_first` / `no_allocate` on streaming data. |
| Chunk-based parallelism | `technique-chunk-parallelism` | Linear-attention kernels (GatedDeltaNet, Mamba). |
| Kernel fusion | `technique-kernel-fusion` | Combine elementwise + GEMM + reduction into a single launch. |
| Wide vectorized loads | `technique-vectorized-loads` | Saturate HBM bandwidth; cp.async or 128-bit LDG. |

## Problem → Pattern (Diagnosis)

## Languages / DSLs

| DSL | Page ID | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| CuTe DSL | `lang-cute-dsl` | Preferred high-level path on SM100; native tcgen05/TMEM/CLC bindings. |
| CUDA C++ | `lang-cuda-cpp` | PTX inline is common; used by CUTLASS, vLLM, SGLang custom kernels. |
| PTX (SM100) | `lang-ptx` | `tcgen05.*`, `clusterlaunchcontrol.*`, `cp.async.bulk.tensor.*` — low-level control. |
| Triton | `lang-triton` | On Blackwell: Triton 3.6+ ships native tcgen05 + TMEM lowering through descriptor/TMA + `tl.range(warp_specialize=True)`, `tl.dot_scaled`, and Gluon multi-CTA / 2CTA. Pre-3.6 the framing was "no tcgen05/TMEM exposure"; that historical context is preserved on the page. Cite via `version_sensitive: vs-triton-3.6-blackwell-tcgen05`. |

## Migration (Hopper → Blackwell)

| Page ID | Notes |
|---|---|
| `migration-wgmma-to-tcgen05` | wgmma (Hopper) → tcgen05 (Blackwell); CTA-scope vs cluster-scope MMA; descriptor changes. |
| `migration-register-to-tmem` | Register accumulator (Hopper) → TMEM (Blackwell); epilogue restructuring required. |

## Confidence & Evidence Quick Reference

- **`verified`** — page carries an `evidence_basis` list with at least one `official-doc` AND one `upstream-code` entry. Safe to quote as authoritative.
- **`source-reported`** — claims come from ≥ 1 authoritative source (paper, official blog, major repo). Most wiki pages live here.
- **`inferred`** — synthesized from multiple sources; flag when quoting.
- **`experimental`** — undocumented / version-sensitive / PTX tricks. Always caveat.

Minimum reproducibility for technique, kernel, and language pages: **`snippet`** (compilable fragment) — validator-enforced.
